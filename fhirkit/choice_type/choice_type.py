    Used to provide extra information about a field, either for the model schema or complex validation. Some arguments
    apply only to number fields (``int``, ``float``, ``Decimal``) and some apply only to ``str``.

    :param default: since this is replacing the fieldâ€™s default, its first argument is used
      to set the default, use ellipsis (``...``) to indicate the field is required
    :param default_factory: callable that will be called when a default value is needed for this field
      If both `default` and `default_factory` are set, an error is raised.
    :param alias: the public name of the field
    :param title: can be any string, used in the schema
    :param description: can be any string, used in the schema
    :param exclude: exclude this field while dumping.
      Takes same values as the ``include`` and ``exclude`` arguments on the ``.dict`` method.
    :param include: include this field while dumping.
      Takes same values as the ``include`` and ``exclude`` arguments on the ``.dict`` method.
    :param const: this field is required and *must* take it's default value
    :param gt: only applies to numbers, requires the field to be "greater than". The schema
      will have an ``exclusiveMinimum`` validation keyword
    :param ge: only applies to numbers, requires the field to be "greater than or equal to". The
      schema will have a ``minimum`` validation keyword
    :param lt: only applies to numbers, requires the field to be "less than". The schema
      will have an ``exclusiveMaximum`` validation keyword
    :param le: only applies to numbers, requires the field to be "less than or equal to". The
      schema will have a ``maximum`` validation keyword
    :param multiple_of: only applies to numbers, requires the field to be "a multiple of". The
      schema will have a ``multipleOf`` validation keyword
    :param max_digits: only applies to Decimals, requires the field to have a maximum number
      of digits within the decimal. It does not include a zero before the decimal point or trailing decimal zeroes.
    :param decimal_places: only applies to Decimals, requires the field to have at most a number of decimal places
      allowed. It does not include trailing decimal zeroes.
    :param min_items: only applies to lists, requires the field to have a minimum number of
      elements. The schema will have a ``minItems`` validation keyword
    :param max_items: only applies to lists, requires the field to have a maximum number of
      elements. The schema will have a ``maxItems`` validation keyword
    :param max_items: only applies to lists, requires the field not to have duplicated
      elements. The schema will have a ``uniqueItems`` validation keyword
    :param min_length: only applies to strings, requires the field to have a minimum length. The
      schema will have a ``maximum`` validation keyword
    :param max_length: only applies to strings, requires the field to have a maximum length. The
      schema will have a ``maxLength`` validation keyword
    :param allow_mutation: a boolean which defaults to True. When False, the field raises a TypeError if the field is
      assigned on an instance.  The BaseModel Config must set validate_assignment to True
    :param regex: only applies to strings, requires the field match against a regular expression
      pattern string. The schema will have a ``pattern`` validation keyword
    :param discriminator: only useful with a (discriminated a.k.a. tagged) `Union` of sub models with a common field.
      The `discriminator` is the name of this common field to shorten validation and improve generated schema
    :param repr: show this field in the representation
    :param **extra: any additional keyword arguments will be added as is to the schema
